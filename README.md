# Hardhat Funding Project

## About This Project

- It's part of the FCC Blockchain course.
- In this smart contract, we have features for funding and withdrawing the amount.
- It also stores the funders addresses with the amount they funded.
- Only the contract deployer can withdraw the funded amount.
- In this, we're using Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface priceFeed to get the current price of the blockchain tokens.
